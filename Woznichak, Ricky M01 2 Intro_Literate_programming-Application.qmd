# Creating a Variable

```{r}
X <- "This is my first assignment"
```

## Print X

```{r}
X
```

# Adding Text in Base R

## Example from R's help document

```{r}
paste("Hello", "World", sep = " ")  
paste0("Hello", "World")  
paste("Number:", 1:5, sep = " ")  
```

## paste()\` function, add "and I'm loving it!" to \`X\`

```{r}
X <- paste(X, "and I'm loving it!")
```

```{r}
X
```

# Creating and Modifying a Vector

```{r}
Y <- c(2, 3, 4, 5)
```

## Multiply by 2

```{r}
Y <- Y * 2  
```

## Print Y

```{r}
Y  
```

# Printing Variables

```{r}
X
Y
```

# Finding *Maximum* and *Minimum* Values

```{r}
max(Y)
min(Y)
```

# Loading `ggplot2` and Viewing `economics` Data

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
head(economics)
```

# Visualizing economics Data

## Variable Descriptions

-   `date`: Date of data collection
-   `pce`: Personal consumption expenditures (billions)
-   `pop`: Total population (thousands)
-   `psavert`: Personal savings rate (percentage)
-   `uempmed`: Median duration of unemployment (weeks)
-   `unemploy`: Number of unemployed persons (thousands)

### *Call-Out*

::: callout-note
Let's explore `unemploy`(unemployment numbers) against `pop`(population), as they are likely correlated.
:::

### **It's GGPLOT Time!**

```{r}
#| label: fig-unemployment-population-1
#| fig-cap: "Unemployment vs Population"
plot <- 'ggplot'(economics, aes(x = pop, y = unemploy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Unemployment vs Population",
       x = "Total Population (thousands)",
       y = "Number of Unemployed (thousands)")
plot
```

# Replicating the Chart with Pipe Operator

```{r}
#| label: fig-unemployment-population-2
#| fig-cap: "Unemployment vs Population"
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-asp: 0.5
economics |>
  'ggplot'(aes(x = pop, y = unemploy)) +
  geom_point(color = "red") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "black", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Unemployment vs Population",
       x = "Total Population (thousands)",
       y = "Number of Unemployed (thousands)")

```

# Findings and Cross-Reference

::: {.callout-important appearance="simple"}
## What did we learn?

As seen in @fig-unemployment-population-1, As the population increases, the number of unemployed individuals also increases.This suggests that unemployment scales with population growth.
